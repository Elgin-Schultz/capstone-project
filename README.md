## profan

This app contains a selection of former, now secular places of worship in Hamburg. In part, their sacred significance can still be guessed at, in part nothing of it can be felt anymore. The compilation is not bound to a certain denomination, there are former Jewish, Christian and pagan sites.
All locations are indicated with their geographical coordinates, old and new place names. With the color photographs I want to capture the mood of today's sites, they are not meant to give an overview of the current state. They are contrasted with the historical visual material, which shows the change of time. Where possible, the documents are chosen to tell us something about the reason for the profanation. In contrast to this are the selected quotations. In this way, a new view of the everyday cityscape emerges.
